# (Latest notebook)Improve score by EDA/Feature Engg, House price
### House Price prediciton:
I'm attempting this competition a second time here, my first attempt was 4 months ago, with a public score of 0.16806, when I didn't analyse the data extensively and feature selection was based on assumptions. My goal this time is to get better at my EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS-EDA and overall prrocess and not just to improvise the score. We will be analysing data extensively based on statistics and not on assumptions

Update: EDA and Feature Engineered data in this notebook coupled with a basic Linear Regression model got an improvement in the score(rmse: 0.14285) compared to my previous notebook attempt using Hyperparameter tuned Lasso Regression(rmse: 0.16806), I think that implies deeper Data Analysis alone can greatly improve the performance without the need for using complex models for training. May be that's why we hear lot of Data Scientists stressing on the importance of preparing and working on the data rather than fancy models.

Please upvote if you find the notebook useful!




# (my earlier notebook)House-Price-Prediction-Kaggle-competition
My jupyter notebook for House price predicition form Kaggle competitions
with a public score of 0.16808, based on root mean squared logarithmic error. I used Lasso Regression model here and still working on to improvise my outlier detection & scoring methods, any suggestions are welcome!
